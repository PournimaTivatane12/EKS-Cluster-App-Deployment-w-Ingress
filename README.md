# 2048 Game

Overview

This project is an implementation of the popular game 2048. The objective is to combine tiles of the same number until you reach the 2048 tile. Each move shifts all tiles in the selected direction (up, down, left, right), and a new tile with a value of 2 or 4 appears on the board after each move. The game ends when no moves are left.

Features

ðŸ‘‰ Simple and intuitive controls.
ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic tile generation and merging logic.
ðŸ‘‰ Score tracking based on tile merges.
ðŸ‘‰ Restart functionality to begin a new game anytime.

Technologies Used

ðŸ‘‰ HTML: Structure of the game.
ðŸ‘‰ CSS: Styling the game board and tiles.
ðŸ‘‰ JavaScript: Game logic for movement, tile merging, and score calculation.

How to Play

1. Start the Game: Press the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles.
2. Combine Tiles: When two tiles of the same value collide, they combine into one (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8).
3. Goal: Continue merging tiles until you create the 2048 tile or higher.
4. End Game: The game ends when no more moves are possible.
5. Score: Your score is calculated based on the value of the merged tiles.

Future Improvements

ðŸ‘‰ Add an undo feature to reverse the last move.
ðŸ‘‰ Implement additional animations for tile merging and movement.
ðŸ‘‰ Add a leaderboard to track high scores across games.
ðŸ‘‰ Implement mobile touch controls for a more responsive experience.
